Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-is the prosses of creating and maintainging a software
-it impotance becouse of 1.create user frendly software 2.reliability
3.efficiency


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1.disign-creatin of how it will be biuld nd used
2.inplementation-code used to desing
3.deplyment/testing-making sure the software is working correcty nd realising it

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-planning
-desining
-coding
-testing
-deployment
-maintanace
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
-waterfalls follows a set of oders.ie recipes for cooking
-agile its more flexible and adapts to changes easly

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
-software developer.buld the software by writting codes
-quality assuareance.test the software to find and fix codes
-project manager.plans and manage the project to make sure its done on time and budget

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDES.helps write and test codes by prviding tools in one place 
-VCS.keeps track to changes on the codes and allows you to go back to earlier versins

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-bug fixing
-comlexity
-deadlines
-performance issues

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-unit.test individual codes to make sure they work correcty on ther own
-interigence.test how different componets of the software work together
-system.test the copmplet software to make sure is working well
-acceptance.verifies it the software meets the uses needs and requrement

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-is disigning and refing the input given to al models.helps in accuracy,efficient and quality

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
